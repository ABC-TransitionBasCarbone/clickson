  "abc-energy-fuel-description": "Your school probably has one or several boilers or furnaces for heating. Boilers consume heating oil, natural gas or fuelwood to produce heat, and in the process emit large amounts of greenhouse gases.Record the quantity of fuel consumed in the course of one year by your school (for instance, January through December). The school might have a general bill or different bills. In the case of a general bill just insert the data in the fields below, in the case of different bills youâ€™ll have to do some math and to check your results with your teacher. If you are considering periods of time shorter than a year you should be aware that time is relevant in this data and you should consider the seasonal variation when calculating an average.",
  "abc-energy-electricity-description": "Your school is connected to the power grid in your country. Electricity is generated by nuclear power plants, coal-fired plants, hydropower dams, and is increasingly supplied by wind turbines, solar panels and other renewable energy installations. Record here the electricity consumption for your school (we suggest to insert records for one whole year, from January to December). The school should have an electricity bill (normally it is one for one year). It is country dependent and it should be automatic in the calculator - set when the teacher sets the country.",
  "abc-energy-advanced-description": "Your school undoubtedly has science labs equipped with bunsen burners that produce a flame by burning natural gas, and so they also emit greenhouse gases. For the purposes of your estimation, assume that 100% of the gas is consumed by the flame. Gather information on the amount of gas consumed for the science labs, workshops and other classroom activities, and enter the associated CO2 emissions. Your science lab should have its own bills on the gases that are used for the scientific experiments.",
